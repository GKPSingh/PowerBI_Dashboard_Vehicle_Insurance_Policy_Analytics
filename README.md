### Key Financial Findings
Overall Performance: The company faced consistent insurance losses over the period, with a total of $9.2bn in claims against only $4.0bn in total premiums across 2014-2018. This resulted in an average premium-to-claim ratio of 44%, indicating the company was paying out far more in claims than it collected in premiums.
Premium to Claim Ratio Trend: The premium-to-claim ratio (which appears to be displayed inversely in the provided data as 'Premium to Claim Ratio' at 44%) significantly worsened over the years. The bar chart shows the ratio of claims to premiums growing steadily, from under 50% in 2014 to well over 200% by the first two quarters of 2018, demonstrating a clear unprofitability trend.
Average Values: The average claim amount of $18K was more than double the average premium of $8K.
Business and Policy Demographics
Policy Mix: The bulk of EIC's policies were for automobiles, trucks, pick-ups, and motor-cycles.
Top Makes: Toyota and Isuzu were the most frequent vehicle makes insured.
Profitable Segments: While most segments were unprofitable (with ratios well over 100%), certain usages like Ambulance, Car Hires, Fare Paying Passengers, and General Cartage were relatively more profitable in earlier years, but their profitability eroded by 2018 (pp. 2-4). The "Private" use category, which accounted for the largest share of policies opened, was consistently highly unprofitable.
Outcome
The accumulation of these factors led to a situation where the insurer was consistently unprofitable, necessitating the decision to close the company in 2019
